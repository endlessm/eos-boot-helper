# The purpose of this script is to identify if we are running on target
# Endless hardware and if so, enlarges the root partition to use
# all available space.
# When disk space is plentiful, we also carve out some space at the end of
# the disk, and use it to create a swap partition.
#
# It is important to identify that this system is an Endless-flashed device
# that desires such treatment.

# For platforms using a GPT partition table, we do this by detecting that GPT
# flag #55 is set on the root partition, which is deliberately set in EOS
# images. If you need to avoid such repartitioning, just remove that flag
# before first boot.
#
# When dealing with a DOS partition table we do this by detecting that the type
# code for unused partition entry 4 has magic number 'dd', which is
# deliberately set in EOS images. If you need to avoid such repartitioning,
# just remove that 4th partition before first boot.
#
# The 55 flag (or the "dd" marker) is also removed after this script is run,
# providing a quick/cheap way of knowing that our work is done, avoiding going
# through all this logic on each boot.
#
# This script is written carefully so that it can be interrupted after each
# operation, on next boot it should effectively continue where it left off.
#
# Special attention is given to the fact that modifying the partition table
# causes the kernel to re-read the partition table, which causes udev to
# quickly remove and recreate device nodes for affected disks. We call
# "udevadm settle" after each partition table change to make sure that udev
# has caught up with these events.
#
# Based on code from dracut-modules-olpc.
